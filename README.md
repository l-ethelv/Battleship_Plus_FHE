# Battleship Plus FHE: Enhanced Strategy on the High Seas ðŸš¢âš“

Battleship Plus FHE reimagines the timeless classic of naval warfare by integrating **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This groundbreaking implementation allows players to engage in a strategy game where encrypted ship types and special abilities add depth and excitement to the experience. Players will navigate, strategize, and deploy their fleet with confidentiality and tactical innovation that traditional games simply cannot offer.

## The Challenge of Classic Gameplay

Traditional strategy games often lack the ability to maintain player privacy and integrity of game mechanics. Players are left vulnerable to adversarial tactics, where strategies can be predicted, and game results can be influenced by non-compliant behavior. Battleship Plus FHE addresses these concerns by integrating advanced encryption into the core gameplay, ensuring that each player's strategies remain confidential and their gameplay experience is more enjoyable and secure.

## Leveraging FHE for Secure Gameplay

Through the use of **Zama's open-source libraries** like **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, we enable a new layer of tactical depth. With Fully Homomorphic Encryption, each ship typeâ€”ranging from stealthy submarines to powerful aircraft carriersâ€”has unique, encrypted abilities that can be executed in-game without revealing their underlying strategies. This encryption not only protects player data but also enhances the strategic possibilities available to players, promoting a more dynamic gameplay environment.

## Highlights of Battleship Plus FHE

- **Encrypted Ship Types**: The game features a variety of warships, each equipped with unique abilities encoded securely using FHE.
- **Special Skills Execution**: Players can use special maneuvers like stealth attacks or area bombardments, securely executed via homomorphic operations.
- **Dynamic Tactical Options**: Classic gameplay revitalized with new strategic approaches, promoting a richer and more engaging experience.
- **Competitive and Fun**: Increased interaction and tactical challenges make the game more competitive and enjoyable for players.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's FHE SDK (Concrete & TFHE-rs)**: The backbone of our confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: For server-side runtime environment.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Development framework for building the smart contracts.
